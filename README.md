# Some on my Bee Explorations with some processing

Here lies my processing and researching for the Rutgers Bee Project. In the unfortunate case that you want to run everything on your machine, you're out of luck because the data isn't here. But if you do have the data, you can run my code by first cd'ing into a directory, and then (to install the dependencies, of course), run this in terminal:

```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links file:///tmp/packages
```

Then you can use python to run your files to your heart's (‚ù§Ô∏è) desire. 

Happy Hunting, and Good Luck üëç
